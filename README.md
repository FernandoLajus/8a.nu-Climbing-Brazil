# 8a.nu-Climbing-Brazil
Data from the website https://www.8a.nu/ arranged to reflect the climbing scene in Brazil. The database was originally created by Dcohen21 (https://github.com/dcohen21) and can be found in its entirety here: https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook.

I have merely created the repository that reflects Brazil, fixing common problems to Webscrape like typos, and including the latitudes and longitudes of the favourite locations to climb in Brazil.
