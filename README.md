# 8a.nu-Climbing-Brazil
Data from the website https://www.8a.nu/ arranged to reflect the climbing scene in Brazil. The database was originally created by Dcohen21 (https://github.com/dcohen21) and can be found in its entirety here: https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook.

I have simply created the repository that reflects the climbing scene in Brazil, fixing common problems to Webscrape practices like typos and inconsistent data, while also including the latitudes and longitudes of the favourite climbing locations in Brazil.
